# simple-chat
this is a simple chat application that I create using ruby on rails in order to pass the technical test that held by Rakamin Academy as the purpose of Backend Developer Recruitment Test

I'm using action cable for this application. and there is no particular extension for running this program. just run the server and you will see my works.

I'm so sorry if the app is still far from your expectation. I tried to learn ruby on rails as fast as I could for this test. I know there is still many flaw on the app. but at least, I could say that I'm proud of my learning potential.

Thank you Rakamin Academy for the oppurtunity. without this test, I will never meet my chance to learn how to use Ruby on Rails.
